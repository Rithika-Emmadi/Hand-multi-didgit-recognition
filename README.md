# Hand Multi-Digit Recognition

This repository contains a project for recognizing handwritten multi-digit numbers from images using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to process and classify images containing sequences of digits, making it suitable for applications such as digitized forms, bank checks, and other scenarios involving handwritten numbers.

## Features

- Recognizes multiple handwritten digits in a single image
- Utilizes deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) for robust feature extraction
- Preprocessing pipeline for image normalization and augmentation
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- (Optional) Visualization utilities for predictions
